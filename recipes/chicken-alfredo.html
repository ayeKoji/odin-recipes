                <ul>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</ul>
                <ul>1 tablespoon butter</ul>
             <h3>For the Sauce</h3>
                <ul>1/2 cup butter , cut into large cubes or slices</ul>
                <ul>2 cups heavy whipping cream</ul>
                <ul>1 clove garlic , minced</ul>
                <ul>3/4 teaspoon garlic powder</ul>
                <ul>3/4 teaspoon <strong><u>Italian seasoning</u></strong></ul>
                <ul>1/4 teaspoon salt</ul>
                <ul>1/4 teaspoon pepper</ul>
                <ul>2 cups freshly grated Parmesan cheese</ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
             <ol>1.<strong> Make the noodles:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine and cook until al dente according to package directions, usually 10 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, then drain well. Set aside.</ol>
             <ol>2.<strong> Make the chicken:</strong> Season chicken breasts with the Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.</ol>
             <ol>3. Warm the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Once it’s shimmering, swirl the pan to evenly distribute. Add the chicken and leave it undisturbed for 5-7 minutes, until the bottom is golden-brown. Flip over and add in 1 tablespoon of butter between them, picking up the pan to give it a gentle swirl to distribute. Continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes (or an internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.)</ol>
             <ol>4. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 3 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Tent with foil while you prepare the sauce.</ol>
             <ol>5.<strong> Make the Alfredo sauce</strong> In the same pan, over medium-low heat, add the butter and cream; whisk until butter has melted.</ol>
             <ol>6. Add in the minced garlic, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper; whisk until combined and smooth.</ol>
             <ol>7. Bring to a gentle simmer (do not boil) and cook for 3-4 minutes, whisking constantly, until it starts to thicken.</ol>
             <ol>8. Stir in the parmesan cheese just until melted and the sauce is smooth. (If the sauce ends up too thick, add some of the reserved pasta cooking water, a few tablespoons at a time, to thin it out.)</ol>
             <ol>9. <strong>Assemble:</strong> Take sauce off the heat and immediately toss with the cooked fettuccine noodles.</ol>
             <ol>10. Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of chicken. Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</ol>
